## Film Query Project

### Overview

Welcome, to the project known as Film Query. Here all your independent favorite films
have been compacted and uploaded into a SQL Database for ease of access to the user.
The program runs of the common structural elements of a good OOP along with a POM.xml
to bring the query to your fingertips.

### Topics
* SQL
* MySQL
* Relational Databases
* JDBC
* MAMP
* Object-Relational Mapping
* Encapsulation
* MVC File
* Spring Suite
* Pair Programming and Remote Collaboration
* Advanced Request Handling
* Gradle
* Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC


#### How it works

1. A user can enter a Film's ID and see the details of the film in a web page.
2. A user can choose to add a new film. They can enter all the properties of the film. Their input will be used to create Film object, which the DAO implementation will save in the database. If the insert fails, the user is informed of this.
3. When a user retrieves a film, they have the option of deleting it. If they delete the film, it is removed from the database. If the delete fails (such as, due to child records), the user is informed of this.
4. When a user retrieves a film, they have the option of editing it. If they choose this, all the film's current properties are displayed in a form, allowing them to change any property except the film's ID. When they submit the form, that film's record is updated in the database. If the update fails, the user is informed of this.
5. A user can search for films by keyword/pattern in title or description. From the resulting list of films, the user can choose to update or delete a record.

### Lessons Learned
1. Group projects require the ability to problem solve using each members thought process to create functional code, if not,
the result can be disastrous.  
2. With the knowledge that we have, not all contingencies can be addressed regarding HTML inputting user inputs.
3. The importance of becoming familiar with GIT and all of its abilities.
4. Experience was gained decoding exception and errors.
5. Division of labor within the group dynamic allowed us to become familiar with the intricacies of each aspect of the project.
6. Coding is never done... There is always something to improve.
